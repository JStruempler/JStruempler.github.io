				<h1>Climate Change</h1>
				<p>Many people believe climate change is simply a change in the weather. In reality, the topic is much more complex than that. More than just a warm sunny day, climate change is long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Many of these changes in climate can be natural, but since the early 1800’s, human activities have been the main factor in influencing an unnatural climate change.</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>Severe change in weather patterns can have a negative impact on health, the ability to grow food, housing around the world, work, and safety. Many areas around the globe are more vulnerable to the impacts, such as coastal communities, island nations, and other developing countries. Whole communities have had to relocate, resulting in a rise of “climate refugees”.</p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>The topic of climate change is expensive, whether governments make changes now or chose inaction. The United Nations is estimating that one critical step is for industrialized countries to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries, to help them move towards greener economies. On the other hand, transitioning to a more sustainable economy could open up many more economic opportunities and jobs. It is estimated that an investment of $1 would yield an average of $4 in benefits.</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>More than 70 countries, including some of the biggest contributors to the current pollution status (China, USA, and the EU) have set a net-zero target, which covers almost 76% of total global emissions. Even with this commitment, current national climate plans fall short of what is required to make a change by 2050. Truly achieving net zero would require all governments to take bold steps towards reducing emissions starting now.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="conclusion">
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Climate change is a pressing concern that everyone should be aware of. While it is up to the governments and major corporations to have a positive impact, the common person can make their voices heard to help influence those who make the decisions. There is still opportunity to make the world a safer place to live in, for generations to come.</p>
