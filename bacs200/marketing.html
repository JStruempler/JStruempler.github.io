    <p>Katie's Handprint is an Alaskan organization, dedicated to supporting Alaskan families through their fight with childhood cancer. Their main efforts focus on the financial burden of cancer, especially as many Alaskan families have to move to find treatment. There are numerous unexpected and unpredictable expenses that come along with the fight against cancer. This organization is founded by Darlis Meyer, who was mom to Katie. The two of them have closed the chapter on Katie's fight with childhood cancer, and moving forward, Darlis strives to support those going on that same journey.
