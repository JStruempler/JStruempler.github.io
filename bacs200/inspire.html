        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than
        Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial
        prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the
        best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed
        everything to make the world better.
