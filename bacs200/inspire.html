        Role models are a large part of what makes you, you. A role model is someone you admire so much, your choices and decisions have them factored in.
        Who we find to be our role model then has a lot to say about what you value, and who you are as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Courageous - they stand up for what they belive is right and lead the way</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        <li>Great kindness - widely known to have a caring heart</li>
        <li>Hard working - they set lofty goals and move forward on that path</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Someone who fully embodies these characteristics to me is Hannah Erickson. Known by many on the University of Northern Colorado campus,
        she always is a hard worker and demonstrates the definition of kindness to everyone. She is an example of someone who works hard to achieve
        their goals, will always be a helping hand, and stands up for what she believes is right.
