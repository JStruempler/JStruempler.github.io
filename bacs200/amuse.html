    <p>Many people turn to the internet for a good laugh, and hopefully these links will help you do just that.</p>

    <h2>Funny News</h2>
    <p>When the news is just a bit <em>too</em> serious, sometimes some silly news (that is &apos totally real &apos) is a great solution.</p>

    <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
    <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.  I have fond memories of this site listing out some of the best Chuck Norris facts, some of which have lived their way on to infamy.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
