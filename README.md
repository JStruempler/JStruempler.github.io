    <p>Jessica grew up in <em>Anchorage, Alaska</em>. She has got two <strong>Bernese Mountain Dogs</strong> that she loves, and is passionate about both science and the arts.</p> 
     <p>Her mother writes code in her two businesses, so Jessica is excited to learn more. Writing HTML has not been in her portfolio before, so she is excited for this class.</p>
